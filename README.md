Puppeteer + Testable Examples
==============================

This repository contains several examples to help you run Puppeteer and utilize Testable as a remote browser grid.

### Steps to Run

1. Set your API key: `export TESTABLE_KEY=xxx`. API keys can be generated by logging into Testable and going to Org Management => API Keys.
2. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. Choose the example you want to run. For example: `node basic.js` to run the basic example.

### Examples

* `basic.js`: A basic example that loads a page and takes a screenshot
* `all-options.js`: Includes all possible parameters that you can pass Testable when initializing the session.
* `testable-commands.js`: Includes an example for each custom command that Testable accepts around setting pass/fail, logging, metrics, and assertions.
* `openfin.js`: An example that tests an OpenFin application.
